## Introduction
Every year, the NCAA has their Championship Tournament that consists of 64 teams and occurs during March. Hence the name March Madness, bringing in nearly 11 million viewers every year. With it comes the chance for viewers to not only guess the winners of the tournament but also the winner of every game in the tournament. With almost 70 million brackets made each year we can see the hype around predicting these winners. Not only are fans interested in the tournament, many companies also offer prizes for predicting the perfect bracket.
## Problem Definition
The odds of randomly guessing a perfect bracket is 1 in ~9 quintillion.
