# ML-4641
Machine Learning 4641 year-long project by Maxim Vancompernolle, Tenzin Choerab, Helena Zhang, Kaushika Mohan, and Matthew Farias

# Proposal
## Introduction
Every year, the NCAA has their Championship Tournament that consists of 68 teams and occurs during March. Hence the name March Madness, bringing in nearly 11 million viewers every year. With it comes the chance for viewers to not only guess the winners of the tournament but also the winner of every game in the tournament. With almost 70 million brackets made each year we can see the hype around predicting these winners. Not only are fans interested in the tournament, many companies also offer prizes for predicting the perfect bracket.

## Problem Definition
The odds of randomly guessing a perfect bracket is 1 in ~9 quintillion. These chances make it nearly impossible to guess the bracket without taking past data into account. In order to try and predict the bracket for the 22-23 March Madness season, we will use machine learning models on game data from the past 39 basketball seasons to find the possibilities of different game brackets and accurately predict the outcome. 
## Methods
In order to solve this problem, we intend on performing supervised learning by using artifical neural networks and gradient boosted trees to analyze our data.
